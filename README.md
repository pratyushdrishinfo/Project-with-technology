# Project-with-technology
This directory contain code sample related to the laravel, Angular, react and angular 6
These are the sample code of the projects on which I have worked since last 3 years.
For the combination of backend and frontend on my first project I have used Laravel as backend technology and Angular.js as frontend.
We created API in the Laravel then we used the frontend technology like React.Js , Angular and Angular 6 in the projects.
